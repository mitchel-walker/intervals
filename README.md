# intervals

Given a text file ('intervals.txt'), this program prints a series of non-intersecting intervals, and then prints them in ascending order according to size. The file intervals.txt has a different interval on each line, with the first and second number delimited by a space.

for example:

14 17

-8 -5

26 29

-20 -15
